graph-editor.js
===============

A graph editor (as in graph theory) written in JavaScript utilizing the canvas
element. Originally written to be part of the Sage computer algebra system, now
it is also a stand alone tool. The library does not pollute your JavaScript
globals, it adds only the "GraphEditor" object.

Ideas for Future Development
----------------------------

+ Edge and vertex colors.
+ More editing options, like turning vertex into a clique, selecting multiple
  vertices and adding edges between sets of vertices.
+ Crazy embeddings, like a graph on a torus or projective plane.
+ graph6 input/output

Have fun!
